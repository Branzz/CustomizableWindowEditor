When worked on: May 2020

### Features

* Elements based on time with a time slider and play/pause, like the YouTube player
* Custom backgrounds
* Transitions like blurring, pixelating, in and out, at different time rates
* Image effects with intensity
* Fractals (shape that expands on itself)
* My own font that is generated out of just math with a size variable
