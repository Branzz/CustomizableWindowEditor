MS paint with a time variable

When worked on: May 2020

History:

Really crappy project layout (as a result of it being old), so there is a revised version with a normal package structure.

Features:
* Elements based on time with a time slider and play/pause, like a film
* Custom backgrounds
* Transitions like blurring, pixelating, in and out, at different time rates
* Image effects with intensity
* Fractals
* My own font that is generated out of just math with a size variable
* Colors for all of those
